This was probably the most challenging homework assignment I have had.

For the Part 1 - Scraping, I was successful in gathering the required outputs which included:
- News Title
- News Paragraph
- Featured Image
- Mars Facts table
- Table of Hemisphere images

For Part 2 - MongoDB and Flask:
- I was able to create a working scrape_mars.py file.
- On Monday night I met with my tutor, and he helped me get the
  index.html and the Flask to work.  I did create a PyMongo database, 
  and I have attached a screen shot to show it:
	- Mongo Database Image.jpg
- I also had a working HTML site, captured in a screen shot:
  	- HTML Screen Shot 1
- Unfortunately, when I started working on updating the index file to show
  the elements, the Flask would not run, and I was not able to complete
  building the final page.
	- I did create a 2nd "scrape2_mars file that runs.

To summarize, I ran out of time due to work meetings on the day this was due.
